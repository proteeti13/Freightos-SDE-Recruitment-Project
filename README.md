# Freightos-SDE-Recruitment-Project

Well, this is my first ever recruitment project. So I've made pretty much dumb mistakes as I've only 24hour to come up with the idea on my lazy brain ( check them out in the readme.pdf inside the zip file )

But despite of my mistakes, I really put my effort on designing the UML diagram and tried to foolproof it as much as possible. Clinic appointment system is pretty messy and I tried to make the process easy and handy for both the doctor and the patient side. 

n.b.  If I had to do the project now, I would have gone for problem 1. That's way too interesting !
